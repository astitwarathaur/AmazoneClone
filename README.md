# AmazoneClone
This project involves building a static clone of the Amazon homepage using only HTML and CSS. The goal is to replicate the visual layout and basic structure of the Amazon website, demonstrating proficiency in front-end development fundamentals.

HTML Structure:
Create a well-organized HTML document with semantic elements (header, nav, main, footer, sections, etc.) to accurately represent the Amazon layout.
Implement the necessary HTML elements to display images, text, links, and form elements.
Structure the page to reflect the primary navigation, search bar, product sections, and footer.

CSS Styling:
Apply CSS rules to replicate the visual design of the Amazon homepage, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
Utilize CSS grid and flexbox for responsive and flexible layout management.
Style various elements like buttons, input fields, images, and text to match the original design.
Implement hover effects and basic interactive styles.
Aim to get the layout as close to the real amazon homepage as possible.
